# Looking-Up-Passwords
Design for an authenticating a userâ€™s password. One possible way to implement is using a file to store computer user login usernames and passwords. The program will then present a login prompt, read one username, present a password prompt, and after looking up the username's password in the hash table, will print either "Authentication successful" or "Authentication failure".
